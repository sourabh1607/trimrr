#  trimrr — Modern URL Shortener with Click Analytics

**trimrr** is a sleek, modern, full-stack URL shortening platform built with **React (Vite)**, **Supabase**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn UI**. It lets users shorten URLs, optionally customize them, generate QR codes, and track click analytics including device type and location in real-time.

This project was built from scratch integrating authentication, protected routing, cloud storage for QR images, device and location tracking using external APIs and libraries, and data visualizations via interactive charts.

##  What This Project Does

-  **User Authentication:**  
  Email-based signup and login using Supabase Auth.

-  **Shorten and Manage URLs:**  
  Users can create both random and custom short URLs pointing to any original URL.

-  **QR Code Generation:**  
  Automatically generate QR codes for every short URL and store them in Supabase Storage Buckets.

-  **Click Tracking:**  
  Records each time a short URL is visited, logging:
   - **Device type** (mobile, desktop, etc.)
   - **Visitor’s city and country** (via `ipapi.co`)

-  **Analytics Dashboard:**  
  View:
   - Total clicks
   - Top cities by clicks
   - Device type distribution (pie and line charts via Recharts)

-  **Protected Routes:**  
  Authenticated access only for:
  - Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
  - Individual Link Stats (`/link/:id`)

-  **Copy, Download, Delete**  
   - Copy short URL
   - Download QR Code image
   - Delete URL (with confirmation)

## How It Works (Step by Step)

1. **React project initialized using Vite.**
2. **Tailwind CSS** and **Shadcn UI** installed for styling and components.
3. Supabase project created with:

   * `urls` table for managing URL entries.
   * `clicks` table for storing click logs.
   * Supabase email authentication enabled.
4. Created **protected React routes** using React Router.
5. Built authentication pages:

   * `/auth` (Login/Signup with validation and email auth)
6. Developed a **Dashboard** displaying user’s short links, search functionality, and click stats.
7. Integrated **QR code generation** and uploaded to Supabase Buckets.
8. Set up click logging:

   * Captures visitor’s city and country via `ipapi.co`
   * Detects device type with `ua-parser-js`
   * Stores analytics in `clicks` table.
9. Visualized analytics with **Recharts** (Line chart for location, Pie chart for device type).
10. Enabled copy, download, and delete actions for links.
11. Added loaders, spinners, and error handling for all async operations.
